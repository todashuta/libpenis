libpenis
===
Comparing variables was never been that easy and clear like using *libpenis*.

Usage
---
Traditional comparing:
```C
int a = 1;
int b = 1;
if (a == b)
    printf("Success!\n");
```

penis.js comparing:
```C
set_balls(1);
set_dick_head(1);
if(B==D)
    printf("Success!\n");
```
Caution
---
libpenis uses the global variables "B" and "D" such that you can use the awesome command "B==D" to compare 2 variables everywhere. 

License
---
libpenis is currently under **Giant Penis License(GPL)** which is a deformed M.I.T license included a penis ascii code.
